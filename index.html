      Note the usage of %PUBLIC_URL% within the tags above.
      It gets substituted with the URL of the `public` folder during the build process.
      Files outside the `public` folder cannot be referenced directly from the HTML.

      Unlike using "/favicon.ico" or just "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" ensures 
      correct functioning with both client-side routing and non-root public URLs.
      Learn about configuring a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
